# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QMKonnect documentation site built with Jekyll has critical routing issues. The home page at `/` returns an error instead of displaying the main documentation page. The site navigation and structure need to be fixed to provide a proper user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Home Page Routing

**User Story:** As a user visiting the QMKonnect documentation site, I want to see the main documentation page when I navigate to the root URL `/`, so that I can immediately access the project information and navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the root URL `/` THEN the system SHALL display the main QMKonnect documentation page
2. WHEN the home page loads THEN the system SHALL display the project title, description, and key features
3. WHEN the home page loads THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation to installation, configuration, and other documentation sections
4. WHEN the home page loads THEN the system SHALL include prominent "Get Started" and "View on GitHub" buttons

### Requirement 2: Jekyll Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the documentation site, I want the Jekyll configuration to properly handle routing and navigation, so that the site works correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jekyll builds the site THEN the system SHALL generate a proper index.html at the root
2. WHEN Jekyll processes the site THEN the system SHALL correctly handle the baseurl configuration for GitHub Pages
3. WHEN Jekyll builds the site THEN the system SHALL generate proper navigation links between pages
4. WHEN the site is deployed THEN the system SHALL work correctly with the `/qmkonnect` baseurl on GitHub Pages

### Requirement 3: Navigation Structure

**User Story:** As a user browsing the documentation, I want clear and consistent navigation throughout the site, so that I can easily find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any documentation page THEN the system SHALL display a consistent navigation menu
2. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct pages without errors
3. WHEN the navigation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current page as active/highlighted
4. WHEN the site loads THEN the system SHALL display pages in the correct order (Home, Installation, Configuration, Usage, etc.)

### Requirement 4: Build Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Jekyll build process to complete without errors and generate a functional site, so that the documentation can be properly deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `bundle exec jekyll build` THEN the system SHALL complete without critical errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate all required HTML files in the `_site` directory
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a functional `index.html` at the root of `_site`
4. WHEN running `bundle exec jekyll serve` THEN the system SHALL serve the site locally without routing errors

### Requirement 5: GitHub Pages Compatibility

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the documentation site to deploy correctly to GitHub Pages, so that users can access the documentation at the proper URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is deployed to GitHub Pages THEN the system SHALL be accessible at `https://dabstractor.github.io/qmkonnect/`
2. WHEN users navigate to the GitHub Pages URL THEN the system SHALL display the home page correctly
3. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL build and deploy the site successfully
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL handle all internal links correctly with the proper baseurl
