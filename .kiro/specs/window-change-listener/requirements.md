# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the system tray application to monitor active window changes and communicate window information to a connected keyboard via HID protocol. The application will detect when the user switches between applications or windows and extract relevant metadata (namespace and title) to send to the keyboard through the qmk_notifier package. This allows the keyboard to display or react to the current application context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a compatible keyboard, I want the application to automatically detect when I switch windows, so that my keyboard can display or react to the current application context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active window changes THEN the system SHALL detect the window change event within 100ms
2. WHEN a window change is detected THEN the system SHALL extract the application namespace (process name or bundle identifier)
3. WHEN a window change is detected THEN the system SHALL extract the window title
4. WHEN window information is extracted THEN the system SHALL send both namespace and title to the keyboard via qmk_notifier

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle different operating systems consistently, so that the feature works regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use Windows-specific APIs to monitor window changes
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use macOS-specific APIs to monitor window changes
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use Linux-specific APIs to monitor window changes
4. WHEN extracting window information THEN the system SHALL normalize namespace format across platforms
5. WHEN extracting window information THEN the system SHALL handle Unicode characters in window titles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that window monitoring continues even when individual operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN window information extraction fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue monitoring
2. WHEN HID communication fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation up to 3 times
3. WHEN HID communication fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue monitoring without crashing
4. WHEN the system cannot access window information due to permissions THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be efficient with system resources, so that it doesn't impact my computer's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring window changes THEN the system SHALL use event-driven detection rather than polling
2. WHEN the same window remains active THEN the system SHALL NOT send duplicate notifications
3. WHEN processing window changes THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 50ms
4. WHEN running continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage below 50MB

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to integrate with the existing system tray functionality, so that I have a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the window monitoring SHALL start automatically
2. WHEN the user selects "Quit" from the tray menu THEN the window monitoring SHALL stop gracefully
3. WHEN the application is running THEN the tray icon SHALL remain visible and functional
4. WHEN window monitoring encounters errors THEN the tray icon SHALL remain responsive
