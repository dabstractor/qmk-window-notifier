# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables Windows-specific settings management for the QMK Window Notifier application, providing a standardized way to store and retrieve application configuration data including product ID and usage page settings. The settings will be stored in the appropriate Windows application data location and include a dedicated "Settings" section for user configuration management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the application to store its settings in the standard Windows application data location, so that my configuration follows Windows conventions and is properly managed by the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts on Windows THEN the system SHALL use the Windows AppData\Roaming directory for configuration storage
2. WHEN storing configuration data THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated folder structure under AppData\Roaming\QMK Window Notifier
3. WHEN accessing configuration files THEN the system SHALL handle Windows file path conventions and permissions correctly
4. WHEN the configuration directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically with appropriate permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want to configure product ID and usage page settings through a dedicated Settings section, so that I can customize the application behavior for my specific QMK keyboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating configuration THEN the system SHALL include a [Settings] section in the configuration file
2. WHEN the Settings section exists THEN the system SHALL support product_id as a configurable parameter
3. WHEN the Settings section exists THEN the system SHALL support usage_page as a configurable parameter
4. WHEN reading configuration THEN the system SHALL validate that product_id is a valid 16-bit unsigned integer
5. WHEN reading configuration THEN the system SHALL validate that usage_page is a valid 16-bit unsigned integer
6. WHEN configuration values are invalid THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the application to maintain compatibility with existing configuration while adding Windows-specific enhancements, so that my current setup continues to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing XDG_CONFIG_HOME configuration exists THEN the system SHALL continue to support reading from that location as a fallback
2. WHEN both Windows and XDG configuration exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the Windows AppData location
3. WHEN migrating from XDG to Windows configuration THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing settings
4. WHEN configuration format changes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing TOML structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the settings management to integrate seamlessly with the existing service and tray functionality, so that configuration changes are applied without disrupting the running application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Windows service starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from the Windows AppData location
2. WHEN the tray application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from the Windows AppData location
3. WHEN configuration is reloaded THEN the system SHALL update the running application without requiring a restart
4. WHEN configuration file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration with reasonable Settings values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want proper error handling and logging for settings operations, so that I can troubleshoot configuration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to Windows Event Log
2. WHEN configuration directory cannot be created THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt fallback locations
3. WHEN configuration values are invalid THEN the system SHALL log warnings with specific validation failure details
4. WHEN using default values THEN the system SHALL log informational messages indicating which defaults are being used
5. WHEN configuration operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue operation with safe defaults rather than crashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the settings to be easily accessible and modifiable, so that I can customize the application configuration as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating default configuration THEN the system SHALL include clear comments explaining each Settings parameter
2. WHEN configuration file is created THEN the system SHALL use a human-readable TOML format
3. WHEN Settings section is missing THEN the system SHALL automatically add it with default values
4. WHEN the user runs --config command THEN the system SHALL create the configuration in the Windows AppData location
5. WHEN the user runs --reload command THEN the system SHALL reload configuration from the Windows AppData location
