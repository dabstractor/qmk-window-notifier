# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QMK Window Notifier application currently has an issue where Windows installers cannot properly detect when the application has been closed during the installation process. The installer successfully closes the application but never receives notification that the closure was completed, leading to timeouts and installation errors. This feature will implement proper installer communication to ensure smooth installation and upgrade experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user installing or upgrading QMK Window Notifier, I want the installer to complete successfully without timeout errors, so that I can use the application without installation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer requests application closure THEN the application SHALL respond within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the application receives a shutdown signal from the installer THEN the application SHALL terminate all threads and exit the process within 3 seconds
3. WHEN the installer sends WM_QUERYENDSESSION THEN the application SHALL return TRUE immediately to confirm it will close
4. WHEN the installer sends WM_ENDSESSION THEN the application SHALL initiate immediate shutdown and process termination

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle Windows shutdown and logoff events properly, so that the system can shut down cleanly without hanging processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Windows sends a system shutdown signal THEN the application SHALL exit gracefully within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user logs off THEN the application SHALL terminate without requiring force termination
3. WHEN the application receives CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT THEN the application SHALL exit immediately
4. IF the application fails to exit within the timeout period THEN the application SHALL force terminate itself

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application's singleton mechanism to work correctly with installer scenarios, so that installations and upgrades don't fail due to mutex conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is terminated by an installer THEN the singleton mutex SHALL be released immediately
2. WHEN a new instance starts after installer termination THEN the singleton check SHALL succeed without conflicts
3. WHEN the installer force-terminates the application THEN no orphaned mutex handles SHALL remain
4. IF the singleton mutex is in an invalid state THEN the application SHALL reset it and continue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain its normal functionality while also being installer-friendly, so that both regular operation and installation scenarios work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs normally THEN all existing tray functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the application receives shutdown signals during normal operation THEN it SHALL exit gracefully
3. WHEN the application starts after an installation THEN it SHALL initialize normally without errors
4. WHEN multiple shutdown signals are received THEN the application SHALL handle them without crashing
