# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix installer shutdown notification issue










  - Modify the tray.rs file to ensure the installer receives proper notification when the application closes
  - Add a forced exit mechanism with a short timeout to guarantee process termination




  - Ensure the application responds correctly to WM_QUERYENDSESSION messages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Test the fix with the installer


  - Verify that the installer no longer times out when closing the application
  - Ensure the application exits cleanly when requested by the installer
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_
