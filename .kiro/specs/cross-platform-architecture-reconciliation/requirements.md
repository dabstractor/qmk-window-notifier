# Cross-Platform Architecture Reconciliation Requirements

## Introduction

The QMKonnect application currently has conflicting architectural requirements between Windows, Linux, and macOS implementations that have resulted in broken Linux functionality. The Windows implementation introduced service-based architecture, complex startup logic, and platform-specific features that conflict with the simpler Linux console application model. Meanwhile, macOS has its own unique requirements including permission handling, Core Foundation event loops, and application bundle considerations. This feature will reconcile these architectural differences to create a unified, maintainable cross-platform architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified application entry point that can handle platform-specific execution models without conflicts, so that Windows, Linux, and macOS implementations can coexist without breaking each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate execution model based on the target platform
2. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL support service mode, tray mode, and console mode execution paths
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use the direct console execution model without Windows-specific complexity
4. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use the threaded execution model with Core Foundation event loops and tray integration
5. WHEN platform-specific arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL only process them on the appropriate platform
6. WHEN invalid platform-specific arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL ignore them gracefully and continue with default behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any platform, I want consistent configuration management that follows platform conventions, so that my settings are stored in the appropriate location for my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL use AppData\Roaming\QMKonnect for configuration storage
2. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config/qmk-notifier for configuration storage
3. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL use ~/Library/Application Support/QMKonnect for configuration storage
4. WHEN configuration paths are determined THEN the system SHALL create the appropriate directory structure for the platform
5. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the same TOML format across all platforms
6. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL create platform-appropriate default configuration
7. WHEN --config or --reload commands are used THEN the system SHALL operate on the correct platform-specific configuration location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the window monitoring functionality to work consistently across platforms while respecting platform-specific implementation requirements, so that QMK notifications work reliably regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the window monitor starts THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate platform-specific implementation (Windows hooks, Linux X11/Wayland, macOS Core Foundation)
2. WHEN window focus changes THEN the system SHALL detect and process the change using platform-appropriate methods
3. WHEN window information is extracted THEN the system SHALL format it consistently across platforms for QMK notification
4. WHEN the monitor encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without affecting other platform implementations
5. WHEN the monitor stops THEN the system SHALL clean up platform-specific resources appropriately
6. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL request screen recording permissions and handle Core Foundation event loops properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want service and tray functionality to work without affecting Linux users, so that Windows-specific features don't break the Linux implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Windows service features are compiled THEN they SHALL only be available on Windows targets
2. WHEN Windows tray functionality is used THEN it SHALL not interfere with Linux execution paths
3. WHEN Windows-specific dependencies are included THEN they SHALL be conditionally compiled for Windows only
4. WHEN service management commands are used THEN they SHALL only function on Windows and be ignored on other platforms
5. WHEN singleton instance checking is performed THEN it SHALL only apply to Windows tray/service modes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want the application to work with the simple, direct execution model without Windows complexity, so that the Linux implementation remains lightweight and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL use direct console execution without service or tray complexity
2. WHEN Linux-specific features are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented without affecting Windows or macOS functionality
3. WHEN the application starts on Linux THEN it SHALL immediately begin window monitoring without additional startup logic
4. WHEN Ctrl+C is pressed on Linux THEN the system SHALL exit immediately without complex shutdown procedures
5. WHEN Linux dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be conditionally compiled for Linux targets only
6. WHEN Linux window monitoring is restored THEN it SHALL work identically to how it worked before Windows features were added

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of platform-specific code and shared functionality, so that changes to one platform don't inadvertently break others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platform-specific code is written THEN it SHALL be clearly isolated using conditional compilation attributes
2. WHEN shared functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL work consistently across all supported platforms
3. WHEN platform-specific traits are defined THEN they SHALL have consistent interfaces that work with shared code
4. WHEN new platform support is added THEN it SHALL not require changes to existing platform implementations
5. WHEN debugging or logging is performed THEN it SHALL use appropriate platform-specific methods (console, event log, etc.)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle threading and event loops appropriately for each platform, so that the application remains responsive and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Windows hooks are established THEN they SHALL run on the appropriate thread without blocking other functionality
2. WHEN Linux window monitoring is active THEN it SHALL use appropriate threading that doesn't conflict with Windows patterns
3. WHEN tray functionality is used THEN its event loop SHALL not interfere with window monitoring threads
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all platform-specific threads SHALL be cleaned up properly
5. WHEN signal handling is implemented THEN it SHALL work appropriately for each platform's signal model

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling and logging across platforms, so that I can troubleshoot issues regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur on Windows THEN they SHALL be logged to Windows Event Log and/or console as appropriate
2. WHEN errors occur on Linux THEN they SHALL be logged to console or system log as appropriate
3. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN it SHALL provide detailed logging using platform-appropriate methods
4. WHEN the application encounters fatal errors THEN it SHALL exit gracefully on all platforms
5. WHEN logging is performed THEN it SHALL not cause cross-platform compilation issues

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want help and version information to be consistent across platforms, so that I can understand available options regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN --help is requested THEN the system SHALL show platform-appropriate options and hide irrelevant ones
2. WHEN Windows-specific options are shown THEN they SHALL only appear on Windows systems
3. WHEN Linux-specific options are shown THEN they SHALL only appear on Linux systems
4. WHEN version information is requested THEN it SHALL be consistent across all platforms
5. WHEN invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL show appropriate help information for the current platform

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing working Windows and macOS implementations while fixing the broken Linux implementation, so that no regressions are introduced to functioning platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Windows implementation is modified THEN all existing Windows functionality SHALL continue to work identically
2. WHEN macOS implementation is modified THEN all existing macOS functionality SHALL continue to work identically
3. WHEN Linux implementation is fixed THEN it SHALL restore the original pre-Windows-feature functionality
